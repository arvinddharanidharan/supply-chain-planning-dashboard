# ETL Pipeline Enhancements

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Timestamp Tracking
- **Orders Table**: `created_timestamp` column tracks when each order was added
- **Inventory Table**: `updated_timestamp` column tracks inventory updates
- **Suppliers Table**: `updated_timestamp` column tracks supplier data changes
- **Products Table**: `updated_timestamp` column tracks product updates

### 2. Comprehensive Logging System
- **Current Log**: `logs/current_log.txt` - Contains last 7 days of ETL activity
- **Archive Log**: `logs/archive_log.txt` - Contains older logs (7+ days)
- **Log Rotation**: Automatic rotation every 7 days
- **Log Levels**: INFO, ERROR with timestamps and detailed messages

### 3. Enhanced Data Tracking
```sql
-- Example timestamp queries
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE created_timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day';
SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE updated_timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### 4. Log Management Features
- **Automatic Archiving**: Logs older than 7 days moved to archive
- **Detailed Tracking**: Every ETL step logged with timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Failed operations logged with error details
- **Success Metrics**: Record counts and completion times logged

## 🔍 Data Tracking Capabilities

### New Data Detection
```python
# Check for new orders today
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE DATE(created_timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE;

# Track inventory changes in last hour
SELECT * FROM inventory 
WHERE updated_timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

### Log Analysis
- **Success Rate**: Track ETL success/failure patterns
- **Performance**: Monitor ETL execution times
- **Data Volume**: Track daily data generation volumes
- **Error Patterns**: Identify recurring issues

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Full Audit Trail**: Every data change is timestamped and logged
2. **Troubleshooting**: Detailed logs help identify and resolve issues
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track ETL execution times and data volumes
4. **Data Lineage**: Know exactly when each record was created/updated
5. **Compliance**: Complete audit trail for data governance

## 📈 Usage Examples

### Monitor Daily Data Growth
```sql
SELECT DATE(created_timestamp) as date, COUNT(*) as new_orders
FROM orders 
GROUP BY DATE(created_timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### Check ETL Health
```bash
# View recent logs
tail -20 logs/current_log.txt

# Check for errors
grep "ERROR" logs/current_log.txt

# Monitor success rate
grep "completed successfully" logs/current_log.txt | wc -l
```

All enhancements are production-ready and integrated with the existing Docker automation system.
